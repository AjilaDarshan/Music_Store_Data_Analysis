Data Analysis on Music Store using SQL Case Study

Using the Music Store Dataset, this project shows the use of various SQL queries to explore the data and gain valuable insights from it.SQL skills that are demonstrated in this project are sorting and filtering the data, aggregate functions, joining multiple tables using JOINS, and creating the CTE (Common Table Expression).

In this case study, we help the store to take data-driven decisions by giving valuable insights from data like 
1) which city made the most money for the store?
2) Which customer like to listen what kinds of genre?
3) Top Bands with most music in specific genre
4) How much customers are spending more on which artist?

This type of data analysis help the store to take decisions on which steps store should take to increase there revenue model.
